# zai-speckit

Centralized **requirements and specifications** repository for the Zai platform. Pure requirements, user stories, and API contracts - no implementation code.

## Purpose

This speckit serves as the **single source of truth** for what to build, designed to be included as a Git submodule in both frontend and backend repositories.

**This is NOT implementation code** - it contains:
- Business requirements and user stories
- API contracts (what the API should do)
- Data requirements (what data is needed)
- User flows (how users interact)
- Acceptance criteria (how we know it's done)

## Structure

```

**Organization:** Features are grouped by domain to keep the repo organized as it grows. Domains are specific to the AI backoffice configuration system.

## Usage as Submodule

### In Frontend Repository
```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:100x-fi/zai-speckit.git specs
```

Frontend developers:
- Read feature specs to understand what to build
- Reference API contracts to know how to call backend
- Follow user flows for UI/UX implementation
- Use acceptance criteria to verify completeness

### In Backend Repository
```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:100x-fi/zai-speckit.git specs
```

Backend developers:
- Read feature specs to understand requirements
- Implement API contracts as specified
- Ensure data requirements are met
- Use acceptance criteria for testing

### Updating Specs
```bash
cd specs
git pull origin main
cd ..
git add specs
git commit -m "Update specs to latest"
```

## Finding Features

**Start with [INDEX.md](INDEX.md)** - Master list of all features organized by domain with status tracking.

## Example: Login Feature

See the complete login feature example in the `auth` domain:
- **Feature spec**: [`features/auth/login.md`](features/auth/login.md) - User stories and requirements
- **API contract**: [`api-contracts/auth/auth-login.md`](api-contracts/auth/auth-login.md) - Endpoint behavior
- **Data requirements**: [`data-requirements/auth/user-auth.md`](data-requirements/auth/user-auth.md) - Data needed
- **User flow**: [`user-flows/auth/login-flow.md`](user-flows/auth/login-flow.md) - How it works
- **Acceptance tests**: [`acceptance/auth/login-acceptance.md`](acceptance/auth/login-acceptance.md) - How to verify

## Folder Details

### `/features`
High-level feature specifications with user stories, requirements for both frontend and backend, and out-of-scope items.

### `/api-contracts`
Detailed API requirements: endpoints, request/response formats, error codes, behavior expectations. Both teams implement to this contract.

### `/data-requirements`
What data is needed, validation rules, data flow. Backend implements storage, frontend implements display/input.

### `/user-flows`
Step-by-step user journeys, UI states, navigation. Primarily for frontend but backend needs to understand the flow.

### `/acceptance`
Test scenarios in Given/When/Then format. Both teams use these to verify implementation is complete and correct.

## Contributing

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Add to INDEX.md** with ðŸ’¡ status and choose appropriate domain
2. Create feature spec in `/features/{domain}/{feature-name}.md`
3. Create API contract in `/api-contracts/{domain}/{endpoint-name}.md`
4. Document data requirements in `/data-requirements/{domain}/{entity-name}.md`
5. Map user flow in `/user-flows/{domain}/{feature-flow}.md`
6. Write acceptance tests in `/acceptance/{domain}/{feature-name}-acceptance.md`
7. **Update INDEX.md** with links to all files and change status to ðŸ“‹

See `auth/login` example as template.

### Adding a New Domain

If none of the existing domains fit:
1. Create new domain folder in all 5 directories
2. Add domain section in INDEX.md
3. Update this README with the new domain

### Updating Existing Specs

1. Update the relevant files
2. Add "Last Updated" date
3. Notify both frontend and backend teams
4. Update both repositories' submodules

## Principles

- **Requirements, not implementation** - Describe what, not how
- **Single source of truth** - One place for all specs
- **Team-agnostic** - Both frontend and backend reference the same specs
- **Clarity over completeness** - Clear and actionable beats exhaustive
- **Keep it current** - Outdated specs are worse than no specs
- **Examples included** - Show, don't just tell
