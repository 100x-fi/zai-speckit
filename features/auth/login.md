# Feature: User Login

**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Target Release:** v1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-20

## Overview

Users need to authenticate to access the platform. Login should be simple, secure, and work seamlessly between frontend and backend.

## User Stories

### US-001: Login with Email and Password

**As a** platform user
**I want to** log in with my email and password
**So that** I can access my account and use the platform

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can enter email and password
- System validates credentials
- On success: User is redirected to dashboard with valid session
- On failure: Clear error message is shown
- Session persists across browser refreshes

### US-002: Remember Me Option

**As a** returning user
**I want to** stay logged in across sessions
**So that** I don't have to log in every time

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- "Remember me" checkbox available on login form
- When checked, session lasts 30 days
- When unchecked, session lasts until browser closes
- User can log out manually at any time

### US-003: Error Handling

**As a** user
**I want to** see clear error messages when login fails
